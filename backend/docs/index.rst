Backend documentation
=====================

Authentication
--------------

Authentication in OS2BOS is based on SAML 2.0 single sign-on. Support for this is implemented through the module `PySAML2`_.

.. _PySAML2: https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2

Once a user has been authenticated, a session is created containing the attributes given to us from the IdP, e.g. the Active Directory groups the user belongs to.

SAML based single sign-on (SSO)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SAML SSO delegates the login process to the IdP, and as such, requires an IdP supporting SAML single sign-on.

Settings related to SAML SSO can be found in the ``SAML2_AUTH`` object in ``settings.py``.

User setup
""""""""""

In local development and test, SAML SSO is used with `SimpleSamlPHP`_ as idP.

Users and user profiles are defined in ``dev-environment/authsources.php`` for local development. If you wish to add a new user, you need to add an entry to the file following this template:

.. code-block::

   '<brugernavn>:<password>' => array(
        'email' => '<email_adresse>',
        'username' => '<brugernavn>',
        'first_name' => '<fornavn>',
        'last_name' => '<efternavn>',
        'team' => '<team (navn)>',
        'bos_profile' => '<profil>'
   ),

A user that is not allowed to use OS2BOS, must have a SAML-token with an empty or missing ``bos_profile`` entry. 

User profiles
"""""""""""""
There are four user profiles corresponding to four different levels of permissions.

- "readonly" - the user can only read, not write.
- "edit" - the user can both read and write, but cannot perform grant operations.
- "grant" - the user can both read, write and perform grant operations, but cannot access Django admin.
- "admin" - the user can read, write, perform grant operations and access Django admin.

Integrations
------------

Serviceplatformen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use Serviceplatformen to fetch information from the CPR register. Support for this is implemented through the module `service_person_stamdata_udvidet`_.

Settings relevant to Serviceplatformen can be found in the ``SERVICEPLATFORM_UUIDS`` object and the ``SERVICEPLATFORM_CERTIFICATE_PATH``, ``USE_SERVICEPLATFORM``, ``USE_SERVICEPLATFORM_PROD`` keys in ``settings.py``.

PRISME
^^^^^^

OS2BOS can export daily payment files for import into the `PRISME` economy system. The format of the files are based on KMD's interface specification `GF200001Q`_ for creditor records (transaction type G68).

Release procedure
-----------------
We manage releases using the `Gitflow`_ model.

.. _Gitflow: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

- Create a release branch for the release, e.g. ``release/1.0.0``.
- Bump the version and changelog in ``NEWS.rst`` and ``VERSION`` according to `Semantic Versioning`_.
- `Optional`: Check our dependencies for new security bugfixes.
- `Optional`: In case of API changes, save the OpenAPI schema ``openapi.yml`` from ``<OS2BOS URL>/api/openapi/?format=api`` for use in documentation.
- Test the release and verify that it doesn't contain any breaking bugs or regressions.
- Create an ``rc`` tag, e.g. ``1.0.0-rc1`` on the release branch to make it deployable on staging.
- In case of further development, make pull requests against the release branch and create a new ``rc`` tag.
- Proceed with development and rc-tagging on the release branch until the customer is happy.
- Create a pull request from the release branch to ``master`` for review of ``VERSION`` and ``Ç¸EWS.rst`` bump.
- Create a pull request from the release branch to ``develop``.
- Merge the pull requests.
- Create a release tag, e.g. ``1.0.0`` from ``master``.
- Push develop, master and tags to `the OS2BOS Github`_ as the new core version.
- Delete the release branch.
