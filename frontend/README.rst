=============

The web GUI is a single page application based on the `VueJS framework. <https://vuejs.org/>` 
In broad terms, the GUI comprises the following components:

* `VueJS <https://vuejs.org/v2/api/>` for templating and UI logic (view layer)
* `Vue Router <https://router.vuejs.org/api/>` for routing between views
* `Vuex <https://vuex.vuejs.org/api/>` for sharing data between Vue components
* `axios <https://github.com/axios/axios>` for communicating with the backend REST API
* A modified version of `Semstrap <https://iamfrank.github.io/semstrap/>` for basic CSS styling
* `Vue CLI <https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/>` for build tooling
* `Testcafe <https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/getting-started/>` for E2E testing
